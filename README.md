Queuing Model Simulations
Project Overview
This project explores the accuracy of simulation models against theoretical queuing constructs such as M/M/1, M/G/1, M/M/c/N, and Network of Queues using the JMT simulation software. The primary goal is to validate the software's precision in replicating standard queuing configurations and understanding their application in real-world scenarios.

Installation
Prerequisites
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above
JMT (Java Modelling Tools) software
Setup
Download and install Java if not already installed: Java Download
Download the latest version of JMT from: JMT Download Page
Install JMT according to the provided instructions on the download page.
Usage
To run the queuing model simulations:

Open the JMT software.
Load the project configurations provided in the /simulation_configs directory.
Navigate to the simulation environment within JMT.
Select the model you wish to simulate (e.g., M/M/1, M/G/1).
Configure the simulation parameters as described in the /docs directory.
Run the simulation and observe the results.
